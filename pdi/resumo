LEARNING FRAMEWORK

<PARAGRAFO HORRIIIIIIIVELLLL>
The network is trained in a supervised manner.

The training dataset consists of pairs of noisy and clean images.

The reaction force weight \lambda, the linear filters and influence functions
for each stage are the parameters that are going to be trained.

The cost function is the usual quadratic loss function, comparing the resulting
image with its clean version.

Only the result of the last stage is considered.

This training scheme is called joint training by them.

In other words, all parameters from all stages are trained with respect to only
the final result.

Each layer is greedily pre-trained individually to help deal with the sensitivity
to parameter initialization in deep models. The output of each stage is compared
against the clean original image.

Influence functions are represented as weighted linear combination of a family of
radial basis functions (RBFs). In particular, they consider only Gaussian RBFs.

The linear kernels are defined as linear combinations of Discret Cosine Transform
(DCT) basis kernels.

The reaction force is constrained to be positive.
